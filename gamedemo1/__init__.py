Demo Project: Game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project serves mainly as an example project for my
 `Pluralsight <http://www.pluralsight>`_ video course.

The idea is to simulate a very simple role-playing game where two characters
fight. The game mechanics are controlled by the :class:`game.Game` class and the
characters are :class:`~gamedemo.player.Player` instances, each of which has a
:class:`~gamedemo.weapons.Weapon` to attack with.

The scenario we will try to simulate is of an old-fashioned knight fighting
a fire-breathing dragon.
